A Note on Leaf Match Confidence Levels*
=========

- >89% - **Certainly to be of the same type** (no questions asked :-) ) and contain identical features
- 81~89% - **Very likely to be of the same type** and contains trace variances 
- 71%~80% - **Likely**, but there are some notable features (bend angles, lobe sizes) that differ between the leaves.
- 61~70% - **Possible**, but less likely match
- 51~60% - **Unlikely**, major differences (in leaf widths/ sizes)
- <50% - **Certainly not a match**, leaves have little to no similar features

*Values determined by mass testing with different and same leaves, and mapping percentage match values with expected outcomes
